We use an update() to iterate through all the Entities, and update their
states.

We use a draw() to iterate through all the Entities and draw them on screen.

function GameEngine() {
  this.entities=[];
  this.ctx = null;
  this.lastUpdateTimestamp = null,
  this.deltaTime = null;
};

GameEngine.prototype.draw = function(callback) {
  //loop through all entities, call draw()
}

GameEngine.prototype.update = function() {
  //loop through all entities, call update();
};
